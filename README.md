# CPU Scheduler

**Project Description:**

The CPU Scheduling Simulator is an interactive web-based application designed to simulate and compare various CPU scheduling algorithms. It allows users to visualize the execution of processes under different scheduling strategies, including First Come First Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), and Round Robin (RR). The simulator provides insights into how these algorithms manage process execution and impact system performance metrics such as turnaround time, waiting time, and throughput. This project aims to be an educational tool for understanding the principles and trade-offs of CPU scheduling in operating systems.

## Features

- Supports multiple CPU scheduling algorithms:
  - First Come First Served (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
- User-friendly interface for adding processes with their arrival and burst times.
- Dynamic visualization of scheduling results.
- Calculation of key performance metrics: average turnaround time, average waiting time, and throughput.

  ## Internal Working
**Theory of CPU Scheduling**
CPU scheduling is a critical component of operating systems where the scheduler determines which process gets the CPU next. The goal is to optimize CPU utilization and minimize turnaround time, waiting time, and response time. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the algorithms implemented:

*First Come First Served (FCFS):*

- Processes are executed in the order they arrive.

- Simple but may lead to the "convoy effect" where short processes wait behind long ones.

*Shortest Job First (SJF):*

- Executes the shortest job first.

- Minimizes average waiting time but requires accurate prediction of burst times.

*Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF):*

- A preemptive version of SJF where the shortest remaining time process is executed.

- Minimizes response time but requires frequent context switching.

*Round Robin (RR):*

- Each process gets a small time slice (time quantum) to execute.

- Ensures fairness but can lead to higher context switching overhead.
